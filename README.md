Organization overview 

Mommy’s Sou Chef was baked into life in September 2017, right in the heart of Cape Town. It all started with a daughter who missed the taste of her mom’
s kitchen and dreamed of sharing it with the world. Blending a pinch of nostalgia with a dash of French flair, she created a bakery that brings Mom’s beloved recipes to life—one buttery
bite at a time. Mommy’s Sou Chef isn’t just about pastries; it’s about memories, family, and the sweet joy of feeling right at home
Vision Statement

To become the go-to bakery that bridges generations, creating a timeless space
where tradition meets creativity, and every sweet bite tells a story of heritage and joy.

Mission Statement

Our mission is to bring local natives back to their cherished childhood memories through old ingredients and reinvented 
recipes, while introducing the youth to a taste of the past—allowing all ages, from children to elders with a sweet tooth,
to experience a different time and place without leaving their community.

The target audience for this business is both the youth and the old natives. The people between the ages of 3+ until those people have a sweet tooth
