    <h2> Our story </h2>
    <p> Mommy’s Sou Chef was baked into life in September 2017, right in the heart 
        of Cape Town. It all started with a daughter who missed the taste 
        of her mom’s kitchen and dreamed of sharing it with the world.
         Blending a pinch of nostalgia with a dash of French flair, 
         she created a bakery that brings Mom’s beloved recipes to life—one
          buttery bite at a time. Mommy’s Sou Chef isn’t just about pastries;
           it’s about memories, family, and the sweet joy of feeling right at
            home

     <h2> Our mission </h2>
     <p> Our mission is to bring local natives back to their cherished 
        childhood memories through old ingredients and reinvented recipes,
         while introducing the youth to a taste of the past—allowing all ages, 
         from children to elders with a sweet tooth, to experience 
        a different time and place without leaving their community.</p>
